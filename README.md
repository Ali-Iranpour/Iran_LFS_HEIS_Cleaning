# Iran HEIS and LFS (1392-1401)

## Overview
This repository contains an **RMarkdown script** to clean and standardize **10 years** of **Iranian Labor Force Survey (LFS)** and **Household Expenditure & Income Survey (HEIS)** data from **1392 to 1401 (2013-2022)**. The cleaning process ensures **variable consistency**, removes **missing values**, and makes the datasets ready for further analysis.

## Features
- **Standardizes LFS & HEIS variables** across 10 years.
- **Cleans missing values & inconsistencies** to improve data quality.
- **Ensures cross-year comparability** for analysis.
- **Outputs ready-to-use datasets** for research and modeling.

## Data Source & Availability
- The original datasets can be downloaded from:  
  ðŸ”— **[amar.org.ir](https://amar.org.ir)**  
- This repository contains **only the cleaning script**; the datasets are not included due to size and privacy concerns.
